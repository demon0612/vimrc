# /home/zhl/.vim/vimrc

This Vim configuration is meant to make Vim feel more like an IDE than a simple console-based text editor.
I use it mostly under with MacVIM and Linux GVim though I occasionally run it directly in a terminal.

## Installation

### Clone with GIT

Run these commands to get this Vim configuration working on your OS X or Linux machine.
You can run `git pull` inside of `~/.vim` if you'd ever like to grab the latest version.

```bash
cd ~
git clone git://github.com/demon0612/vimrc.git .vim
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc # Optional, needed for some VIM installations
```
